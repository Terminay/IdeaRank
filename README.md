## Tech Stack

IdeaRank is built to be lightweight, fast, and highly customizable.

- **Frontend:** HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript, CSS3 (Custom Design System with CSS variables and flex/grid).
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js.
- **AI Engine:** [Groq SDK](https://groq.com/) utilizing the `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model for instant inferences.
- **Utilities:** `html2canvas` for scorecard generation.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- A free API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Byte-ne/IdeaRank.git
   cd IdeaRank
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory (you can use `.env.example` as a template):
   ```env
   # Your primary Groq API Key
   GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_primary_key_here
   
   # Fallback API Key for rate limits (Optional but Recommended)
   GROQ_API_KEY_BACKUP=gsk_your_backup_key_here
   
   # Server Port
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   *The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.*

## Current architecture

IdeaRank is a simple, stateless web app: the browser sends your idea to a Node/Express API, which calls Groq (Llama 3.3) and returns the analysis. No database, no sign‑in, no data stored between requests.

- **Client (Web UI)**  
  - Static HTML/CSS/JS served to the browser.  
  - When you click “Analyze”, it sends an HTTP request (e.g. `POST /analyze`) with your idea text.

- **Server (Node.js / Express)**  
  - API routes (like `/analyze`) receive the request, read and validate the idea text.  
  - The route calls an internal AI service that:
    - Builds the prompt and payload.
    - Calls the Groq API with your idea.
    - Parses the response into a structured result (JSON/text sections).  
  - The API then sends this result back to the browser as JSON or rendered HTML.

- **AI (Groq / Llama 3.3)**  
  - The actual model runs on Groq’s cloud.  
  - IdeaRank never stores your ideas; it just forwards them to Groq and returns the model’s reply.

- **Infra & config**  
  - Hosted on a static+Node platform (e.g. Netlify or similar) that serves the UI and runs the Express server.  
  - Secrets like `GROQ_API_KEY` are provided via environment variables (`.env`), not hard‑coded.
